# OpenTofu infrastructure

## Scope

- Artifact Registry Docker repository with deployment-safe retention
- Dedicated staging/production Cloud Run runtime identities
- Dedicated GitHub WIF pool and per-environment providers restricted by repository, immutable owner ID, exact environment subject, and staging-branch/semantic-tag ref
- Separate staging/production GitHub deployers, runtime identities, and Secret Manager secrets
- Separate read-only planner and protected privileged apply identity for saved-plan OpenTofu automation
- Secret-level publishable/anon Supabase access; service-role keys are rejected by runtime readiness
- Cloud Run v2 services, probes, scaling, and public invocation
- Production localized-page and Supabase-dependency uptime plus 5xx, p95 latency, instance saturation, runtime-failure, loader, and unexpected-mutation alerts

## Bootstrap

1. Create a remote GCS state bucket with versioning, uniform access, soft delete, and bucket-scoped `roles/storage.objectAdmin` for the backend identity. Do not use a bucket retention policy: it can prevent deletion of the lock object.
2. Authenticate the backend/bootstrap identity, then run `tofu init -backend-config=bucket=BUCKET -backend-config=prefix=aestheticlab`.
3. Copy `terraform.tfvars.example` to an untracked `terraform.tfvars`, replace the placeholder digest, and set all required values.
4. Run `tofu plan -lock-timeout=60s -out=tfplan.bootstrap`, cancel without applying, and verify the GCS `.tflock` object is released. Resolve backend IAM/locking before any infrastructure write.
5. For a fresh project, bootstrap APIs, Artifact Registry, and the two secret containers first: `tofu apply -target=google_project_service.required -target=google_artifact_registry_repository.containers -target=google_secret_manager_secret.supabase_key`.
6. Add the shared project's publishable/anon key to both environment-specific secrets through Secret Manager. Never use `service_role` or `sb_secret_*` keys in this application. Separate secrets preserve independent IAM and version promotion even when their value is initially identical.
7. Push an immutable bootstrap image and set `initial_image` to its GAR digest. Existing services must be imported with their current immutable GAR digest.
8. Run `tofu plan -out=tfplan`, review replacement/IAM/public-access changes, then apply the initial saved plan with the bootstrap identity.
9. Add `github_repository_variables` plus the state, image, and Supabase URL/version values below as repository variables. Add the alert email as the `ALERT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` repository secret. Add each `github_environment_variables` output to its matching environment.
10. Grant the `infrastructure-plan` service account bucket-scoped `roles/storage.objectViewer`; grant the protected `infrastructure` service account bucket-scoped `roles/storage.objectAdmin` for state locking and writes.
11. Configure required reviewers on `production` and `infrastructure`; restrict `infrastructure-plan` and `infrastructure` to `staging`; require PR/security checks on `staging` before enabling deployer variables.

After bootstrap, `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml` is the only apply path. A read-only `infrastructure-plan` identity creates an immutable saved plan without taking or mutating the state lock. The privileged identity is unavailable until the protected `infrastructure` environment approves applying that exact artifact.

Infrastructure workflow variables:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `GCP_WORKLOAD_ID_PROVIDER`, `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Environment-specific outputs for `infrastructure-plan` and `infrastructure` |
| `TF_STATE_BUCKET`, `TF_STATE_PREFIX` | Remote GCS backend coordinates |
| `GCP_PROJECT`, `GCP_REGION` | Target project and region |
| `INITIAL_IMAGE` | Immutable GAR digest used only for bootstrap/import reconciliation |
| `STAGING_SUPABASE_URL`, `PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URLs; they may be identical for this read-only site |
| `STAGING_SUPABASE_SECRET_VERSION`, `PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_SECRET_VERSION` | Tested numeric versions |
| `ALERT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` | Repository secret containing the address for the OpenTofu-managed primary alert channel |

Optional additional channels can be supplied through `additional_notification_channel_ids` in local bootstrap variables.

This root creates secret containers but never secret values or versions. Add keys directly through Secret Manager and grant secret administration only to the bootstrap/rotation identity. Rotate staging first, validate it, then pin the tested numeric production version; deployments never follow `latest`.

## Existing resources

Import existing resources before the first plan; do not recreate live services. Examples:

```sh
tofu import google_artifact_registry_repository.containers projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/repositories/REPOSITORY
tofu import 'google_secret_manager_secret.supabase_key["staging"]' projects/PROJECT/secrets/SUPABASE_KEY_STAGING
tofu import 'google_secret_manager_secret.supabase_key["production"]' projects/PROJECT/secrets/SUPABASE_KEY_PRODUCTION
tofu import 'google_cloud_run_v2_service.web["staging"]' projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/services/STAGING_SERVICE
tofu import 'google_cloud_run_v2_service.web["production"]' projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/services/PRODUCTION_SERVICE
```

Import service accounts and IAM resources as needed, then reconcile the plan. Set `deletion_protection = false` only during initial import if the provider requires it; restore it before apply.

After both environment-scoped deployers have completed a successful deployment:

1. Remove the `qwik-aestheticlab` repository principal from the legacy shared `github-deployer` service account while retaining the other repositories' principals.
2. Keep only secret-level access on the legacy Compute service account during the rollback window.
3. Retire old revisions that use the legacy identity, verify no traffic references them, then remove that final secret binding.
4. Do not remove shared-service-account project roles until its other repositories have migrated to dedicated identities.

## Deployment contract

OpenTofu owns service configuration and IAM. GitHub Actions owns only the container image and exact-revision traffic promotion. Image and traffic fields are intentionally ignored after bootstrap so a later plan cannot roll back a digest or promote an untested revision.

Production releases must reference a commit previously built and scan-verified from `staging`. If the immutable `verified-<commit>` tag is absent, release deployment fails without changing Cloud Run.
