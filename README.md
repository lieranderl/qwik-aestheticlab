Aesthetic Lab is a multilingual marketing and booking site for a beauty studio in Belgium. It uses Qwik City, Supabase-backed content, DaisyUI/Tailwind styling, and a GitHub Actions delivery pipeline to Google Cloud Run.

## Features

- Localized site for `en-BE`, `nl-BE`, `fr-BE`, `ru-BE`, and `uk-BE`.
- Home and pricelist pages with Supabase-backed services, staff, and contact data.
- GetTimely booking, Google Maps, Google Analytics Consent Mode v2, and cookie consent.
- Health/readiness endpoints for Cloud Run and deployment smoke tests.
- Staging and production deployment through GitHub Actions.

## Stack

| Area | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime | Bun `1.3.14` |
| Framework | Qwik `1.20`, Qwik City |
| Language | TypeScript `7` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS `4`, DaisyUI `5` |
| Data | Supabase SSR `0.12` |
| i18n | Qwik Speak |
| Tests | Vitest with V8 coverage, Playwright |
| Quality | Biome |
| Hosting | Google Cloud Run |
| Infrastructure | OpenTofu |

## Local Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Create the local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the Supabase runtime values:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_KEY="your-publishable-or-anon-key"
```

Use only a Supabase publishable or anon key. Do not use `service_role` or `sb_secret_*` keys.

Start the dev server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Development Notes

- Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before making changes.
- Use Qwik APIs only: `component$`, `routeLoader$`, signals/stores, and `$()` handlers.
- Keep Supabase reads server-side in route loaders.
- Select explicit Supabase columns and validate/project raw rows before returning loader data.
- Use `inlineTranslate()` with `key@@Default English Text` for user-facing strings.
- Run `bun run qwik-speak-extract` after adding translation keys.
- Use existing DaisyUI/Tailwind patterns and `src/components/ui/*` primitives.

## Verification

For most changes:

```bash
bun run verify
```

### Test Coverage

`bun run test.coverage` measures the pure/server-side TypeScript modules under
`src/shared/` with Vitest's V8 provider. Generated HTML and JSON reports are
written to the ignored `coverage/` directory.

CI enforces these global minimums:

| Metric | Minimum | Current baseline |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Statements | 80% | 80.44% |
| Branches | 75% | 75.87% |
| Functions | 90% | 90.47% |
| Lines | 84% | 84.64% |

Playwright coverage is reported separately as passed browser scenarios; it is
not mixed into the unit-coverage percentage. The deterministic suite currently
runs 60 scenarios across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit locally, while CI runs
the Chromium project.

For docs-only changes:

```bash
markdownlint --disable MD013 -- <changed-files>
```

For focused checks:

| Change | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Source file | `bunx --bun biome check --write path/to/file` |
| Source file check only | `bunx --bun biome check path/to/file` |
| Unit test | `bunx vitest run path/to/file.test.ts` |
| Unit coverage | `bun run test.coverage` |
| E2E spec | `bunx playwright test path/to/file.spec.ts` |
| Infrastructure | `tofu -chdir=infra fmt -check -recursive`, `tofu -chdir=infra init -backend=false -input=false`, `tofu -chdir=infra validate` |

## Deployment

Delivery is handled by GitHub Actions:

- Pull requests target `staging`.
- A push to `staging` runs quality checks, builds/scans/attests one container image, deploys to Cloud Run staging, and smoke-tests it.
- A published GitHub release promotes the already verified staging digest to production. Production uses a protected environment, no-traffic candidate smoke tests, canary promotion, and rollback handling.

Release tags must match `package.json`:

```text
package.json version 2.8.1 -> release tag v2.8.1
```

Do not reuse or move release tags. Publish a new patch version if a release needs correction.

## Runtime Health

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/healthz` | Process health. |
| `/readyz` | Runtime configuration readiness. |
| `/dependencyz` | Supabase dependency readiness. |

The deployment smoke test also checks localized public pages and security headers.

## Infrastructure

Cloud Run services, Artifact Registry, IAM, Secret Manager bindings, Workload Identity Federation, monitoring, and alerts live in `infra/` and are managed with OpenTofu.

After bootstrap, apply infrastructure changes only through the protected GitHub Actions infrastructure workflow. Do not create persistent console-only drift.
